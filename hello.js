/*  
Welcome, new coder. 
Enter your code on line 7 to print 'Hello, World!' 
to the console (the panel on the right)
*/

console.log ("Hello, World!");
console.log ("Welcome to Turtle Town,");
console.log ("Population 1M.");
console.log ("Pear are good.", "So are oranges.");
console.log ("'Nevermore'");
console.log ('"Nevermore"');
console.log ("Complete!")

/*  
Next, PLAY! 
Modify your code on line 7 to try to accomplish the tasks listed below:

   1. Change the message that is printed. (Done)
   2. Figure out what the parentheses do. Will the code work without them? (No)
   3. Remove one or both quotation marks. Do we need to include both opening and closing quote marks? (Yes)
      Is there a difference between using a single or a double quote (' vs. ")? (In this case no difference)
   4. Remove the semi-colon, ;. (Runs without (;))
   5. Print a number. (Bonus: Print two numbers added together). 
      (With "" is a string and will print "1+1" if "" are used, without "" "1+1" will print at "2")
   6. Print multiple messages one after the other. (Done)
   7. Print two messages on the same line. (Done)
   8. Print a message that contains quote marks, such as Quoth the Raven "Nevermore". (Done)
